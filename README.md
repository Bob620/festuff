# Introduction
Complex analysis of large amounts of EPMA data is often limited or difficult. This is especially true for Soft X-ray Spectrometer(SXES) data as it is not widely used.
This repo uses compressed SXES data points to analyze arbitrary samples given several known Iron, Iron 3+ and Iron 2+ samples. It can identify a best-guess oxidation 
state for each data point's Iron, attempting to ignore interference by other elements also in the sample.

Since this is a programic approch using programmically compressed data it is optimized for large data sets and can search and run on the selected data quickly.
